# EXCEL-PROJECT
DATA ANALYSIS USING EXCEL
In this project I analyze Bycycle Purchase Data in Excel. 
First I undertook some minor cleaning of the dataset, then created an interactive dasboard with interactive visualizations. 
Conduct the analysis by filtering the visualizations based on Marital Status, Education, Occupation, and Region.
